          <p>What other technology for communication has persisted and thrived for over 500 years, transforming cultures
            around the world, fostering education and struggles for freedom and justice? lone goose press is dedicated
            to keeping that tradition alive in a tangible way.</p>
          <p>Since 1989, lone goose press has been publishing limited-edition letterpress works, printed broadsides and
            hand bound books. With this slow, exacting work, owner Sandy Tilcock continues to honor the highest
            standards in traditional book arts.</p>
          <p>Why engage in letterpress printing and craft books by hand at a time when technology allows instantaneous
            multimedia communication and automated publishing on a mass scale?</p>
          <p>Today’s revolutionary innovation is tomorrow’s ordinary convenience, soon taken for granted. While we use
            and appreciate the wonders of digital media and internet communication, we want to invoke a quieter, more
            contemplative approach to sharing ideas and passions.</p>
          <p>The mission of lone goose press is to promote book arts, to celebrate outstanding writing, and to foster
            conversation about community, social justice, and environmental ethics.</p>
