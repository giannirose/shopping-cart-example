        <p>The limited edition, letterpress book All of Him was a true collaboration, evolving over a period of four
          years. The intense, intimate poems deal with Michael and Matthew Dickman’s loss of their older brother to a
          drug overdose. In this video, the poets read excerpts from the work, and artist Keith Achepohl and
          designer/printer Sandy Tilcock talk about the genesis and development of this unique publication.</p>
        <p>The types used are handset Gill Sans for the poems and colophon. Computer generated Beata and Gill Sans
          Light were used for the display types and printed from polymer plates. The types, handset and polymer, were
          printed on a Vandercook 219 proofing press. Sandy Tilcock, lone goose press proprietor designed, printed and
          “bound” the book.</p>
        <p>Papers used are Rives BFK, off-white, for the text pages and Saint-Armand’s Black Denim Canal made from
          clothing industry offcuts for the chemise. The cloth for the box is Duo Graphite from Bamberger Kaliko
          Textiles in Germany.</p>
        <p>The original images are individual trace monotypes which were scanned and adjusted in Photoshop so they
          would be suitable for the making of polymer photogravure plates. Many images were made for each poem. Sandy
          Tilcock, selected the final images used and laid them out on the page for each poem. Once the layout was
          finalized the adjusted image file was sent to Intaglio Editions of Boulder, Colorado where the polymer
          plates were made by Jon Lybrook. The plates were editioned by Sandy Tilcock and Nikolas Wise in the lone
          goose press studio.</p>
        <p>lone goose press thanks all those who guided and assisted the press in the production of the book: Keith
          Achepohl for his wonderful, thoughtful images; Jon Lybrook for his teaching the press how to prepare the
          files for the images; Russ Dodd of Portland, Oregon for providing a tutorial in printing and editioning
          photopolymer photogravures; and Nikolas Wise for his amazing skill at wiping plates such that there was no
          plate tone. And, many thanks to Michael and Matthew Dickman for entrusting lone goose press with the
          manuscript.</p>
